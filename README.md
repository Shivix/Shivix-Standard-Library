# Shivix-Standard-Library
A large library of my own creation. It serves well as a lightweight base if you wish to recreate a header
within the standard as well as showing some new ideas that the standard library does not have.
Also contains some highly experimental headers for me to try out unique ideas.

Note: C++20 is required. This is not meant to replace the standard library, this is focused on aiding my own
future projects as well as helping me practice my skills.

Note2: All headers in the experimental folder are mostly tests, use at your own peril.
