# Shivix-Standard-Library
My own version of the STL and other headers within the C++ standard.

Note: C++17 is required. Based on personal preference as well as a desire to differ more from other implementations
I have decided to ignore backwards compatibility. This improves the readability and usability in many cases and also
removes the need for preprocessor checks on the C++ version.
